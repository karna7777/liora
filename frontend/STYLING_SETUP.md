# Styling Setup Complete ✅

## What's Been Fixed:

1. ✅ **Tailwind CSS v3.4.0** - Installed and configured
2. ✅ **PostCSS** - Configured with autoprefixer
3. ✅ **tailwind.config.js** - Properly set up with content paths
4. ✅ **postcss.config.js** - Configured correctly
5. ✅ **index.css** - Tailwind directives added
6. ✅ **main.jsx** - CSS imported correctly

## To See the Styling:

**IMPORTANT:** Restart your dev server for Tailwind to work:

1. Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Hard refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)

## If Styles Still Don't Appear:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `src/index.css` is imported in `src/main.jsx` (it is ✅)
3. Clear browser cache completely
4. Check that Tailwind classes are being used in components (they are ✅)

The website should now have full Tailwind CSS styling applied!
